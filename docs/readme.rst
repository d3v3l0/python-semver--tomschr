.. warning::

   This is a development version of semver3. It is released
   to give others the opportunity to test and check if
   everything works in their projects. Currently, the API is
   **not** considered stable and subject to change.

   If you rely on stable semver, use semver2 for the moment.
   Refer to section :ref:`release_policy` for further details.
   Once semver3 reached a stable state, we recommend to have
   another look.
